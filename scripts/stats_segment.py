Segment-wise statistics

This tool outputs various statistics for each reference segment (one per line).
It uses the following format:

    - Field #1: show
    - Field #2: segment start time (in seconds)
    - Field #3: segment end time (in seconds)
    - Field #4: speaker label
    - Field #5: segment identification error rate
    - Field #6: duration of correct identification
    - Field #7: duration of confusion
    - Field #8: duration of missed detections
    - Field #9: duration of false alarms

Usage:
  stats [options] <references.repere> <eval.uem> <hypothesis.repere>
  stats -h | --help
  stats --version

Options:
  --uris <uris.lst>        List of shows (one per line).
                           Defaults to the list of shows in reference.
  --with-unknown           Keep unknown in evaluation.
  -h --help                Show this screen.
  --version                Show version.
