In this paper, performance analysis has been done on 3 state-of-the-art i-vectors based speaker identification systems submitted on the REPERE challenge. It is shown that the performance distribution is essentiallty bi-modal: a speaker in a given show is either not recognized at all, or well recognized. A performance prediction paradigm has been developped, in order to predict if a speaker, with given characteristics in training and testing data will be recognized or not. This framework yields interesting prediction results  and enables to identify the characteristics which contribute the most to the correct recognition of the speakers.
